#CSS3 Mixins

Comprehensive array of mixins for LESS, SCSS & SASS that allow you use CSS3 features without having to worry about vendor prefixes. Awesome.

All mixins come with sweet documentation including available values & units, W3 references and even examples. All you have to do is play with them.

PLUS! [Robert Penner's](http://robertpenner.com/) easing equations as cubic-bezier functions, all thanks to the work of [Matthew Lein](http://matthewlein.com/ceaser/). Now you have no excuse not to spice up your CSS3 transitions.
